Computational protein and peptide design is emerging as a transformative 
framework for engineering macromolecules with precise structures 
and functions, offering innovative solutions in medicine, biotechnology 
and materials science. However, current methods predominantly rely 
on generative models, which are expensive to train and modify. Here, we 
introduce the Key-Cutting Machine (KCM), an optimization-based platform 
that iteratively leverages structure prediction to match desired backbone 
geometries. KCM requires only a single graphics processing unit and enables 
seamless incorporation of user-defined requirements into the objective 
function, circumventing the high retraining costs typical of generative 
models while allowing straightforward assessment of measurable 
properties. By employing an estimation of distribution algorithm, KCM 
optimizes sequences on the basis of geometric, physicochemical and 
energetic criteria. We benchmarked its performance on α-helices, β-sheets, 
a combination of both and unstructured regions, demonstrating precise 
backbone geometry design. As a proof of concept, we applied KCM to 
antimicrobial peptide design by using a template antimicrobial peptide as 
the ‘key’ , yielding a candidate with potent in vitro activity against multiple 
bacterial strains and efficacy in a murine infection model. KCM thus 
emerges as a robust tool for de novo protein and peptide design, offering 
a flexible paradigm for replicating and extending the structure–function 
relationships of existing templates.
Protein and peptide design aims to construct synthetic proteins and 
peptides or modify existing ones to achieve new functionalities1,2. Suc -
cessful designs include proteins that inhibit viral infections such as 
influenza3,4, SARS-CoV-25 and HIV6, as well as enzymes that catalyse reac -
tions for which no natural counterparts were previously known7. Addi -
tional applications include biosensors to detect various molecules8, 
including fentanyl9, self-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccines 
for SARS-CoV-210, self-assembling nanomaterials11 and biological logic gates12. In the case of peptides, a simple generative model was 
proposed to design antimicrobial peptides against Cutibacterium 
acnes13. ProT-Diff14, another generative model, produced peptides; of 
these, 34 showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria, as well as in vivo activity against a clinically 
relevant drug-resistant Escherichia coli strain. These advances highlight 
the broad therapeutic and biotechnological potential of computational 
protein and peptide design15.Received: 4 February 2025

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2that use evolutionary algorithms with a structure predictor in the loop 
address different design goals32,33.
As a proof of concept, we chose a 12-residue peptide with antimi-
crobial properties34. We computationally designed derivatives of this 
small peptide, synthesized them chemically and tested their antimi -
crobial activity both in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Our methodology consists of three stages (Fig. 1 ). First, we define an 
optimization model for the KCM approach, characterized by an objec-
tive function to be maximized. Next, we propose an EDA to solve this 
model. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a dataset of proteins with 
known sequences and secondary structures, including α-helices, 
β-sheets and unstructured proteins. We also tested the KCM on pro -
teins that are a combination of α-helices and β-sheets.
The protein design problem is daunting because of the immense 
sequence space and the unpredictable mapping from amino-acid 
sequences to structures35. Even a single amino-acid mutation can mark -
edly alter the structure of a given protein or peptide. We hypothesize 
that our EDA can accurately estimate the distribution of structures 
within sequence space36,37.
Structured peptide design: three types of secondary structure
In our experiments, protein designs dominated by α-helices required 
fewer generations to converge than their β-sheet counterparts, in part 
because α-helices are typically shorter. A termination condition of 
100 generations was applied to α-helical proteins (for example, PDB 
identifiers (IDs) 5U1Y , 3CLQ , 3SB1, 2QQ8 , 3M9Q , 3H25 , 3EWK, 3C8V , 
2QIW , 2OAR, 2LKM and 1MSL ) and proteins lacking defined second -
ary structure (PDB IDs 3W68 , 1R5L and 1N7D ). For β-sheet proteins  
(PDB IDs 1EMN, 1LQL, 1NP6 , 1O6W , 2E45 , 2KXQ , 1S7M and 1P9N), we used 
a termination condition of 1,000 generations or until the global dis -
tance test total score (GDT_TS)38 reached at least 0.9. When the thresh -
old was met earlier (for example, PDB IDs 1O6W , 2E45 , 2KXQ , 1S7M and 
1LQL ), the algorithm was halted before 1,000 generations. For proteins 
with PDB IDs 1EMN, 1NP6 and 1P9N, the algorithm completed the full 
1,000 generations (parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 1). For 
proteins with a combination of α-helices and β-sheets the termination 
criterion was a GDT_TS of 0.9 or higher or 350 generations, whichever 
came first.
In each generation, the number of objective function evaluations 
was calculated by multiplying the population size (five individuals) by 
the samples generated per individual (five) and the total number of 
islands (20), yielding 500 evaluations. In the 21st island, the individuals 
are no longer stochastic generators but amino-acid sequences, so we 
have 25 sequences in this island, requiring 25 evaluations, resulting in 
525 objective function calls per generation.
For proteins primarily composed of α-helices, GDT_TS distribu-
tions trended toward higher values, approaching 1, whereas standard 
root mean square deviation (RMSD_S) distributions approached 0 
(Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). This pattern indicates high struc -
tural similarity and stability among the designs, with minimal variance. 
However, in proteins 5U1Y , 3CLQ and 2QQ8 (Fig. 1d, I, J and L), GDT_TS 
and RMSD_S distributions were more dispersed. This variance may 
stem from disordered regions at one terminus, which lack well-defined 
secondary structure and thus need more generations for convergence.
Proteins dominated by α-helices showed narrow GDT_TS 
s.d. values (0.00–0.07) yet larger RMSD_S variation (0.04–0.42) 
(Supplementary Table 2). Although higher RMSD_S variability helps 
prevent premature convergence, β-sheet proteins typically required 
longer runs and showed more structural diversity, evident in broader 
RMSD_S and GDT_TS distributions. Because β-sheet proteins had an 
average length of 32 residues—nearly double that of α-helical pro -
teins (18 residues)—their search space was inherently more complex. 
Unstructured proteins posed even greater challenges for the algorithm.Computational protein and peptide design is often framed as 
a combinatorial optimization problem, where the goal is to identify 
an amino-acid sequence that folds into a structure with minimal free 
energy1. This challenge is partially mitigated by discretizing side-chain 
conformations (rotamers)16. Thus, the task reduces to finding the 
optimal combination of rotamers that minimizes free energy for a 
given backbone. Alternative formulations include mixed-integer linear 
programming17 and cost function networks18. However, the protein 
design problem remains extraordinarily complex19,20.
Deep learning methods have emerged as powerful tools for protein 
design. Notable examples include ProteinMPNN21, a message-passing 
neural network, ProteinSolver22, a graph-based neural network, and 
ESM-IF123, which integrates a geometric vector perceptron with a 
transformer. Given a structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, 
these models predict the amino-acid sequences most likely to fold 
into the provided structure. Later methods improved upon Pro -
teinMPNN and ESM-IF1 by enhancing sequence recovery and reduc -
ing perplexity through the incorporation of additional structural 
features. For example, SPDesign24 leverages structurally similar tem-
plates and builds a sequence profile to guide design. SPIN-CGNN25 
computes distance-based contact maps and encodes them into a 
graph representation. PiFold26 extracts spatially invariant geometric 
features from atomic coordinates using a residue-level featurizer. 
These strategies support more accurate, flexible and context-aware 
sequence prediction.
Recently, generative models, including diffusion models, have 
been applied to protein design. These models, which include RFDif -
fusion27 and GRADE-IF28, can generate, from random noise, backbone 
structures that can then be paired with protein design networks 
(for example, ProteinMPNN) to produce corresponding sequences. 
Additionally, the integration of language model innovations has 
shown promise in diverse protein design tasks. For example, Struc-
tureGPT29 has been used to suggest sequence modifications that 
would improve solubility and structural stability. Similarly, TPGen30 
has demonstrated the ability to generate short, diverse sequences 
that reliably fold into predefined secondary structures, as confirmed 
by molecular dynamics simulations. The main purpose of generative 
models is to explore new sequences and structures associated with 
new functions.
However, a major limitation of existing generative models is their 
substantial computational cost, primarily due to the need for retraining 
from scratch whenever a new measurable property is introduced into 
the loss function. For instance, training ESM-IF1 incurs a substantial 
computational cost. The model was trained on over 19,000 protein 
structures from the CATH 4.2 database (40% non-redundant) and 
supplemented with 12 million AlphaFold 2-predicted structures. Each 
epoch required 88 h on 32 graphics processing units (GPUs), totalling 
approximately 653 GPU-days. This level of resource consumption high -
lights the impracticality of retraining such models for iterative design 
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose an optimization-based 
model for protein and peptide design—referred to as the Key-Cutting 
Machine (KCM) model (Fig. 1a ). KCM requires only a single GPU and 
enables the seamless incorporation of user-defined requirements 
into the objective function, thus avoiding the repeated retraining 
overhead typical of generative models and simplifying the assessment 
of measurable properties.
In this framework, the ‘key’ corresponds to the target structure and 
its sequence, and a structure-prediction method generates multiple 
copies of this key. KCM then refines these sequences by comparing 
the original key with its predicted copies. We implement an estimation 
of distribution algorithm (EDA)31 using an island model and employ 
ESMFold as the structure predictor to guide the optimization process. 
Importantly, the KCM algorithm does not require training, which allows 
it to be applied directly without the need for large training datasets or 
computationally expensive pretraining procedures. Other approaches

Red points cluster toward higher GDT_TS and lower RMSD_S values, 
whereas blue points show lower accuracy. Protein 2QQ8 (L), which contains an unstructured region, stands out with lower GDT_TS and 
RMSD_S scores compared with other α-helical proteins.

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2showed lower similarity, although extended runs did improve align -
ment. Notably, the highest sequence identity between the best designs 
and the reference sequences was merely 24%, with an average of 11% 
(Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that the algorithm can converge 
on structurally similar solutions despite low sequence identity.
On this same dataset of 23 proteins, using a Bayesian ranking39, 
we compared KCM with three well-known generative models: Pro -
teinMPNN, ESM-IF1 and ProteinSolver. For a given target backbone, 
ProteinMPNN generated 256 sequences in four runs, while ESM-IF1 
and ProteinSolver each produced 250 sequences. For each target, 
we selected the sequence with the highest GDT_TS and the sequence 
with the lowest RMSD for comparison. For KCM, we likewise chose 
the best sequences according to each criterion. For a fair compari -
son, all solutions from each algorithm were sorted on the basis of 
the fitness function used in our algorithm. When examining only 50 
solutions (Supplementary Fig. 1a–f and Supplementary Table 3), KCM 
surpassed the other approaches in RMSD but lagged behind ESM-IF1 
and ProteinMPNN in GDT_TS. When 250 solutions were considered 
(Supplementary Fig. 1g–l and Supplementary Table 4), KCM again 
outperformed all other methods in RMSD but fell short of ESM-IF1 in 
GDT_TS. Note that these proteins might have been used in the genera -
tive models’ training process. In this case, of the 23 proteins tested, only 
two (PDB IDs 1P9N and 5U1Y ) were not included in CATH 4.2, from which 
the training sets of ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1 were taken.
To analyse the performance of KCM when proteins with a com -
bination of α-helix and β-sheet are included, eight new designs were 
undertaken (Supplementary Table 5); the results are reported in 
Supplementary Table 6. Here six out of eight designs achieved a GDT_TS 
larger than 0.9; this is better than the case for β-sheet-only designs, where 
only four out of eight achieved a GDT_TS larger than 0.9, even when more 
computation effort was allowed. The superpositions of the targets and 
their corresponding designs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
To estimate the cost of designing longer sequences, we evaluated 
the structure prediction time of ESMFold on randomly generated 
sequences ranging from 10 to 400 residues. Predictions for sequences 
up to 100 residues required less than 2 s each, while sequences of 400 
residues required approximately 10 times more computation time 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The algorithm was also applied to design two 
proteins of 100 residues each, PDB IDs 2F77 and 2HLQ . After 2,000 
generations the GDT_TS reached 0.38 for both targets, showing a 
limitation in designing proteins of this size without parameter tuning.
Antimicrobial peptide design
As a proof of concept, we selected IDR-2009, a 12-residue peptide 
(sequence KWRLLIRWRIQK) known for its potent antimicrobial acti-
vity34. This peptide was chosen for practical reasons: its antimicrobial 
activity can be readily validated in vitro and short sequences are ame-
nable to synthesis. Additionally, KCM performed well on α-helices 
(Supplementary Table 2). We tested multiple objective function con-
figurations to evaluate whether KCM could generate variants with 
favourable solubility and synthetic feasibility.
We did not assume that the peptide’s function directly depends on 
its geometry. Instead, we investigated whether mirroring its predicted 
backbone and its amino-acid properties and minimizing its energy 
would yield sequences with comparable structure and properties.
To design a set of peptides using the IDR-2009 backbone as a tem -
plate, we proceeded as follows. (1) We obtained the three-dimen  sional 
structure of the peptide using the Google Colab version of Alpha -
Fold 240,41, on the basis of its sequence. Within AlphaFold 2, we used the 
default parameters but increased to 48 recycles and three relaxation 
iterations. Even though this implementation of AlphaFold 2 does not 
use structural templates and uses a limited-size database to construct 
the multiple sequence alignment, the resulting average predicted local 
distance difference test was higher than 0.8, which is considered a con -
fident predicted local distance difference test score42,43. This resulting backbone structure served as the input for our KCM. (2) We conducted 
the design under four different schemes, primarily varying the protein 
similarity function. The four schemes were the following.
All terms included (AT). All terms in equation (1 ) were applied.

microbial activity. We further examined the top 10 sequences from 
each scheme (Supplementary Tables 8–10).

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2NG. We excluded the ND group because its peptides were challenging 
to synthesize and solubilize. We determined their minimum inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) against 11 clinically relevant strains, including 
the ESKAPEE pathogens. Nine of the 12 peptides (75%) exhibited MIC 
values of ≤64 μmol l−1 against at least one strain (Fig. 2a,b ), surpassing 
hit rates from many existing machine learning/deep learning methods. 
The three inactive peptides (AT1, AT2, AT3) belonged to the AT group, 
had low net charge (<2) and displayed lower normalized hydropho -
bicity. This indicates that incorporating all criteria into the objective 
function might increase the complexity of the search landscape and 
hinder the discovery of highly active sequences. Further investigation 
is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
Secondary structure of designed peptides
Because the peptides were designed using different criteria, we sought 
to assess their secondary-structure tendencies. To evaluate secondary 
structure, we subjected the peptides to four different media: water 
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a, e), a helix-inducing medium (trifluoroethanol (TFE) in water, 3:2, v:v; Fig. 2d and Supplementary  
Fig. 4b, e), a membrane-mimicking environment (SDS at 10 mmol l−1; 
Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4c, e) and a β-inducer medium (metha -
nol in water, 1:1, v:v; Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 4d, e).
When geometric similarity criteria were omitted and energy terms 
were minimally weighted (NG group), the designed peptides displayed 
greater structural plasticity. They were initially unstructured forms in 
water and the methanol/water mixture. However, they adopted highly 
helical conformations in the TFE/water mixture and predominantly 
β-like conformations in the membrane-mimicking medium. Peptides 
from the AT and NE groups remained unstructured in water yet adopted 
mostly β-like conformations in SDS and the methanol/water mixture. 
Notably, in the presence of SDS micelles, NE1 showed an equal propor -
tion of β-like and helical structures.
Among the peptides, AT2, AT5 and NE4 formed the most helical 
conformations in the TFE/water mixture, despite being among the least 
amphiphilic peptides. Conversely, AT3 and NE3, which were among the 
more amphiphilic peptides, predominantly retained a β-like structure

secondary structure directly to antimicrobial activity.
Mechanism of action
We next explored the membrane-related mechanism of action of 
a subset of peptides (AT4, NE1, NE2, NG1, NG3) against Acineto -
bacter  baumannii  and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis  
(Fig. 3a). Using N -phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assays 
(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a) and membrane depolariza -
tion assays with 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3-5) 
(Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 5b, c), we found that all peptides 
disrupted the bacterial membrane potential to varying degrees. 
NE1 and NG3 were particularly effective at depolarizing the cyto -
plasmic membrane of A. baumannii. Although none outperformed 
polymyxin B in outer-membrane permeabilization, several pep -
tides matched levofloxacin’s effects, underscoring their potential as 
membrane-targeting agents.
Cytotoxicity assays
Cytotoxicity was evaluated using human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) 
cells (Fig. 3e)45. None of the 12 peptides caused substantial cytotoxicity 
at the tested concentrations (4–64 μmol l−1), contrasting with the paren -
tal IDR-2009 peptide, which did show cytotoxicity34. The lowest cyto -
toxic concentration leading to 50% cell lysis among inactive peptides 
(AT3) was 269 μmol l−1, indicating a favourable therapeutic window.
Anti-infective efficacy in animal models
We tested NE2 and NG1 in two murine models: skin abscess46–49 (Fig. 4 ) 
and a deep thigh infection50–52 (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). In both mod -
els, the peptides reduced A. baumannii bacterial loads by up to two 
orders of magnitude, comparable to the last-resort antibiotic poly -
myxin B and to our other antibiotic control levofloxacin. No weight 
loss or skin damage was observed, indicating good tolerability. These 
results confirm that KCM-designed peptides can achieve clinically 
relevant anti-infective efficacy.
Discussion
This study introduces and validates the KCM approach for computa -
tional structured peptide design. In contrast to purely generative frame -
works, which use trained models to rapidly generate large numbers 
of candidate sequences, KCM iteratively refines candidate sequences 
through structure prediction and optimization. The results observed 
with mixed secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets sup -
port the idea that the α-helices are easier to design than β-sheets; 
when we have only β-sheets we have a lower success percentage (50%, 
Supplementary Table 2) than when we design α-helices and β-sheets 
(success percentage of 75%, Supplementary Table 5). When we have 
only α-helices, KCM achieves 91.6% success (Supplementary Table 2). 
Here, designs that achieved GDT_TS of 90% or more are considered 
successful. Overall, our results demonstrate that KCM can converge 
on sequences whose backbone geometries strongly resemble those of 
target proteins, spanning α-helices, β-sheets, combinations of α-helices 
and β-sheets, and unstructured regions, even when sequence iden -
tity is low. This suggests that KCM effectively explores the structural 
landscape by continuously updating the distribution of candidate 
sequences on the basis of both geometric and physicochemical criteria. 
However, without a proper parameter tuning, KCM was limited when 
designing proteins composed of 100 amino-acid residues or larger.
A key advantage of KCM is its ability to seamlessly integrate a wide 
range of objective functions beyond backbone geometry. In particular, 
it can incorporate Kullback–Leibler divergence or Jeffrey’s distance for 
amino-acid descriptors, as well as energy terms and other chemically 
relevant properties. This flexibility allows researchers to add or remove 
objectives—such as solubility, stability or functional motifs—within a 
single GPU environment, eliminating the need to retrain a deep learning model when new properties are introduced into the loss function. In 
contrast to generative models that require substantial computational 
resources for retraining, KCM offers an adaptable, resource-efficient 
solution for computational protein design.
Another key advantage of the proposed KCM framework lies in its 
interpretability and accessibility. Unlike deep learning-based genera-
tive models, KCM does not require a training phase; instead, it uses an 
explicitly defined objective function to guide the design process, ena -
bling users to control and tailor design preferences directly. In addition, 
KCM employs an island-based evolutionary paradigm that is inherently 
parallelizable. While the current implementation operates on a single 
GPU, each island can, in principle, be executed independently across 
multiple processors or GPUs. This conceptual scalability allows KCM 
to benefit from parallel environments when available, while remaining 
efficient and accessible on modest hardware.
Beyond benchmarking KCM on proteins of diverse secondary 
structure, we applied it to the design of antimicrobial peptides. Despite 
not explicitly encoding direct activity constraints into our fitness 
function, the KCM-derived peptides retained antimicrobial activity 
that was comparable to or exceeded many machine learning/deep 
learning-based designs reported in the literature13,14. Several designs 
also exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the parental antimicrobial pep -
tide (IDR-2009), demonstrating that KCM can discover sequences with 
improved therapeutic windows.
Structural analyses revealed that relaxing energy and geome-
tric similarity constraints leads to higher structural plasticity, with 
designed sequences frequently transitioning between helical and β-like 
conformations depending on environmental factors. Notably, this plas -
ticity did not necessarily reduce antimicrobial activity, suggesting that 
multiple structural pathways can yield effective membrane-disrupting 
peptides. These outcomes highlight the need to balance structural and 
energetic constraints with functional sequence-space exploration.
In summary, KCM provides an alternative paradigm for pep -
tide and protein design, combining the adaptability of an itera -
tive, optimization-based framework with the power of modern 
structure-prediction tools. Its demonstrated success in designing pep -
tides with potent antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity highlights 
the method’s potential in therapeutic development. Future work may 
explore more sophisticated descriptors—such as immunogenicity, 
proteolytic stability and post-translational modifications—as well as 
advanced multi-objective strategies and protein–water interactions, 
especially in the case of intrinsically disordered proteins, to enhance 
both throughput and exploration of sequence space. Ultimately, the KCM 
model represents a promising step toward more versatile and customiz -
able computational design methodologies for proteins and peptides.
Limitations of the study
Despite these advantages, several challenges remain with the KCM 
model. Its reliance on iterative structure prediction makes it more 
computationally intensive than standard pretrained generative 
approaches, such as ProteinMPNN or ESM-IF1, which can complete 
designs in seconds. For example, designing an α-helical sequence in 
our benchmark set requires about 12 h on a single GPU (RTX 3090 Ti) 
coupled with an Intel i5 CPU with 32 GB of random-access memory. This 
task is particularly challenging for short, dynamic peptides, which may 
adopt multiple conformations in solution. Integrating ensemble-based 
structure prediction or incorporating biophysical data (for example, 
nuclear magnetic resonance) could improve accuracy for more flexible 
targets. KCM is currently limited for larger proteins (100 amino-acid 
residues or larger), because population size and number of generations 
will need to increase considerably. This limits KCM’s current design 
capability to structured peptides.
Nonetheless, a key benefit of the KCM framework is that it does not 
require retraining. For instance, incorporating new design constraints 
or targeting a different functionality in a traditional generative model

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2typically necessitates costly model retraining. In contrast, KCM enables 
these changes to be implemented directly by modifying the objective 
function, eliminating the need for reoptimization of the generative 
backbone. This affords greater flexibility in exploring diverse design 
criteria. While repeated structure predictions introduce computational 
overhead, this cost may be mitigated in future iterations through paral -
lelization strategies or the integration of faster structure predictors.
Additionally, a single key (design target) was used to generate 
copies (peptide variants) for experimental testing. Further validation 
is needed to fully establish the generalizability of the proposed method 
for functional design.
Methods
Objective function
The objective function that we propose in this work for the key-cutting 
machine approach consists of a combination of different similarity 
measures between the structure, energy and chemical/evolutionary 
descriptors of a designed protein and those of the target protein. To 
measure structural similarity, we used the RMSD_S53,54, the GDT_TS38, 
the template modelling score (TM_S)55 and the RMSD_DM. The Rosetta 
energy function REF1556 is used to measure the energy of a protein 
structure. Finally, the chemical descriptors computed consisted of a 
subset of the iLearn protein descriptors (Supplementary Table 11)11 and 
the decoded vector representation from the ESM-2 language model57. 
Given the descriptor vectors for a model’s sequence and the reference’s 
sequence, the similarity between them can be computed by using 
Jeffrey’s distance58 (described in detail in Supplementary Section 1).
Notice that all these criteria measure the similarity or difference 
between a particular aspect of a designed protein and the reference pro -
tein. For example, RMSD_S, TM_S, GDT_TS and RMSD_DM all measure 
structural similarity. In this case, the structure of a designed sequence 
is predicted using ESMFold, and the resulting structure is then superim -
posed with the reference structure. On the other hand, Jeffrey’s distance 
between ESM-2 and iLearn descriptor vectors measures how similar 
the two proteins are in terms of both iLearn and ESM-2 descriptors.
The objective function to be maximized by our protein design 
algorithm is given as

and Ed and Er are, respectively, the energy values of the model and refer -
ence structures, both calculated using the Rosetta energy function. 
Also, for all 1 ≤  i ≤ 10, the symbol Di
J denotes Jeffrey’s distance, computed 
from the ith descriptor vector of both the model and the reference 
sequences. Note that the number of such vectors for each protein is 
ten, where nine are computed with iLearn and one with ESM-2. Finally, 
ω ∈ R is a parameter for contracting or dilating the exponential function.
The objective function is unaffected by rotations and transla -
tions of the structure, since both the model and reference structures 
are superimposed before calculating all criteria. Also, each of the 
terms f1, f2 and f3 contributes with a different magnitude to the total 
value of f. Since the maximum value given by the said function is 7, f1 
represents four-sevenths of the total value, while f2 and f3 represent 
one-seventh and two-sevenths of the total, respectively. The weights for f1, f2 and f3 were empirically determined; identifying the optimal 
weighting for each component of the objective function remains an 
important direction for future work. Function f  will also have values 
close to zero when the model and reference proteins are different in 
all the criteria considered.
An important advantage of KCM is its ability to seamlessly incorpo -
rate user-defined constraints. For example, if a user wishes to enforce 
the presence of hydrophobic amino-acid residues at specific posi -
tions (for example, positions i  and j ), the sequence generators (Sup -
plementary Section 2) can be configured to assign zero probability to 
amino-acid residues that do not meet this criterion at those positions. 
Additionally, if the user aims to favour properties such as solubility 
or reduced aggregation, machine learning-based predictors can be 
integrated to define additional terms in the objective function, as 
demonstrated in a related approach59.
KCM algorithm
The algorithm follows the island paradigm60, and in total there are 21 
islands. The islands evolve synchronously and within each island we 
have a general procedure (Fig. 1 ). The first component is a stochastic 
sequence generator (structure of the individuals in the population), 
which depends on the mathematical model designed to learn how 
highly fit sequences are distributed within the feasible solution space. 
That is, each individual in the population encodes a probability distri -
bution over amino acids at each position in the sequence, on the basis 
of one of six stochastic generator models. Sequences are sampled 
from these distributions and evaluated using the objective function, 
with top performers retained for the next generation. Details of the six 
generator models are provided in Supplementary Table 12. The second 
component is a three-dimensional structure predictor; in this case, 
ESMFold was used. It was chosen over the more accurate and confident 
AlphaFold 2 due to its notably faster prediction. The third component 
is the objective function, which is responsible for determining the simi-
larity between the designs and the reference protein (the key). Finally, 
the fourth module is a repository where the top t  sequences generated 
within the islands are stored according to their fitness.
The island model is equipped with a communication strategy. At 
the end of each generation, with probability P , two islands can collabo -
rate, and the information shared is through the sequences. Each island 
stores the top t  sequences with the highest fitness obtained throughout 
all generations of the algorithm. With probability proportional to their 
fitness, m1 sequences are selected from the t  stored in the first island. All 
selected sequences that surpass the fitness of the weakest sequences in 
the second island will replace them. The same procedure is performed 
in reverse order.
Each island from 1 to 20 is equipped with a mechanism that oper-
ates as an EDA-type evolutionary algorithm (Fig. 1 ). Additionally, the 
islands are disaggregated according to the structure of the individuals 
in the population, which will henceforth be referred to as the stochastic 
sequence generator. Each island from 1 to 20 will have pop individuals 
(stochastic generators) with the same structure. In turn, these gen -
erators depend on how the parameters that define them are updated. 
Furthermore, an additional island is introduced, where a traditional 
genetic algorithm is implemented (island 21). All islands evolve syn -
chronously, but structure prediction presents a computational bot -
tleneck. Although each island independently generates candidate 
sequences, all sequences rely on the same instance of ESMFold for 
structure prediction, which is executed sequentially on a single GPU.
The individuals on the islands are constructed from six stochastic 
models (Supplementary Table 12). In model 1, for each position in the 
sequence, the probability of occurrence of each amino acid is deter -
mined. The individuals on islands 1, 2, 3 and 4 are constructed on the 
basis of this model. Models 2–4 include knowledge of amino acids—for 
example, how they are grouped on the basis of properties such as 
polarity, propensity to form part of a specific secondary structure

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2or evolutionary similarity. In this way, three hierarchical models are 
constructed, where for each position in the sequence the probability of 
belonging to one of the groups is determined first, and then, given the 
current group, the probability of belonging to the next group is deter -
mined, and so on until the amino-acid level is reached. The individuals 
on islands 5–16 are constructed on the basis of these models. Model 5 
is a Bayesian network where the nodes represent the positions in the 
sequence. In this network, an arc is drawn from each position to the 
next, reflecting the dependence between successive positions in the 
sequence. The individuals on islands 17 and 18 are constructed on the 
basis of model 5. Finally, model 6 represents a Markov chain between 
each pair of consecutive positions in the amino-acid sequence. In this 
model, the states correspond to the 20 amino acids and the individuals 
on islands 19 and 20 are constructed on the basis of this model.
Additionally, the update of the individuals’ parameters is carried 
out under four different schemes. In the first scheme (A, 
Supplementary Table 12), the parameters (probabilities) are calculated 
on the basis of the absolute frequencies of appearance obtained 
throughout the algorithm (islands 4, 8, 12, 16, 17 and 20). In the second 
scheme (B, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters (probabilities) 
are calculated from the absolute frequencies of appearance but reset -
ting these every ngr generations (islands 3, 7, 11, 15, 18 and 19). In the 
third scheme (C, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters are calcu-
lated on the basis of the probability proportional to the size of the 
accumulated value of the function dr∗ throughout the algorithm 
(islands 2, 6, 10 and 14). In the fourth scheme (D, Supplementary Table 12), 
the parameters are calculated from the probability proportional to the 
size of the accumulated value of the function dr∗ but resetting this every 
ngr generations (islands 1, 5, 9 and 13), where dr∗=max(1−d
10,0) and  
d is the distance between the Cα atoms located at position r* in the  
reference protein and the designed protein after superposition.
To update the parameters of the stochastic generator in genera-
tion i, two sets of sequences are selected. The first set contains m * 
sequences, while the second set contains t* sequences. The first set is 
formed from the m* sequences with the highest fitness among the m 
sequences generated during generation i  (m* ≤  m). To construct the 
second set, t * sequences are selected from the repository that con -
tains the t sequences with the highest fitness generated in each island 
(t* ≤ t ). The selection of the t* sequences is performed with probabilities 
proportional to their fitness sizes (the details for the update rules of 
the stochastic generators are given in Supplementary Table 13 and 
Supplementary Section 2).
The implemented island model, where each island employs a 
distinct stochastic generator within an EDA framework, seeks to maxi -
mize both exploration and exploitation of the vast protein sequence 
space. The six stochastic models capture complementary biological 
and statistical properties, from simple position-wise amino-acid prob -
abilities to hierarchical and context-aware models such as Bayesian 
networks and Markov chains. Combined with four diverse parameter 
update strategies, this design introduces a range of learning dynamics 
across islands. Such diversity improves the algorithm’s ability to escape 
local optima, enhances robustness across protein classes and enables 
the transfer of information through migration. A traditional genetic 
algorithm implemented on island 21 further complements this set-up, 
supporting recombination-driven exploration. This heterogeneous, 
multi-island architecture provides a flexible and scalable foundation 
for general protein sequence design.
Proteins to design
To test the quality of the solutions produced by the KCM, we selected 
a small subset of proteins from the CATH Protein Structure Classifi -
cation database v.4.3.0, which is a free and publicly available online 
resource that provides information on the evolutionary relation -
ships of protein domains61 and classifies them according to the sec -
ondary structures that compose them. This database is available at   http://download.cathdb.info/cath/releases/all-releases/v4_3_0/  
cath-classification-data/cath-domain-description-file-v4_3_0.txt.
In particular, we selected protein segments containing 
mainly α-helices and β-sheets. We also selected some proteins 
(Supplementary Table 14) that did not have well-defined secondary 
structures. In total, 23 proteins were selected, each between 15 and 33 
residues long. We selected these proteins because they represent the 
three most frequent secondary structure types found in experimentally 
determined protein structures: α-helices, β-sheets and disordered 
regions. Additionally, we included test proteins that contain a combi-
nation of both α-helices and β-sheets.
KCM installation
The KCM algorithm can be installed locally as a standalone Python 
program using the Anaconda package manager. Detailed installa -
tion instructions are available in the repository’s README file62. For 
improved performance, we recommend installing a local copy of the 
ESMFold model. To do this, first install ESMFold using the environment.

esmfold environment. Once this is done, activate this environment 
using the conda activate esmfold command and follow the instructions 
described in listing 1.
Before running the KCM program, ensure that the esmfold envi-
ronment is activated.

Peptide synthesis
All peptides for the experiments were obtained from Pepmic and syn-
thesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis with the fluorenylmethyl-
oxycarbonyl protecting group strategy. Peptides were purified using 
reverse-phase liquid chromatography (purity >95%).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
In this study, we used the following pathogenic bacterial strains:  
A. baumannii ATCC 19606, E. coli AIC221 (E. coli MG1655 phnE_2::FRT 
(control strain for AIC222)) and E. coli AIC222 (E. coli MG1655 pmrA53 
phnE_2::FRT (polymyxin resistant; colistin-resistant strain)), Klebsiella 
pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, P . aeruginosa  
PA14 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600. All pathogens were grown 
in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth and on LB agar. Pseudomonas isolation 
(P . aeruginosa strains) agar plates were exclusively used in the case of 
Pseudomonas  species. In all the experiments, bacteria were inoculated 
from one isolated colony and grown overnight (16 h) in liquid medium 
at 37 °C. On the following day, inocula were diluted 1:100 in fresh media 
and incubated at 37 °C to mid-logarithmic phase.
MIC assays
Broth microdilution assays64 were conducted to establish the MIC for 
each peptide. Peptides were added to untreated polystyrene 96-well 
microtiter plates and serially diluted twofold in sterile water, rang -
ing from 1 to 64 μmol l−1. A bacterial inoculum at a concentration of 
106 CFU ml−1 in LB medium was then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the peptide 
solution. The MIC was determined as the lowest peptide concentration 
that completely inhibited bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation 
at 37 °C. Each assay was performed in three independent replicates.

Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-025-01119-2Circular dichroism experiments
The circular dichroism experiments were conducted using a J1500 
circular dichroism spectropolarimeter ( JASCO) in the Biological 
Chemistry Resource Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Experi -
ments were performed at 25 °C; the spectra graphed are an aver -
age of three accumulations obtained with a quartz cuvette with 
an optical path length of 1.0 mm, ranging from 260 to 190 nm at 
a rate of 50 nm min−1 and a bandwidth of 0.5 nm. The concentra -
tion of all peptides tested was 50 μmol l−1, and the measurements 
were performed in water, in a mixture of TFE and water with a 3:2 
ratio, in a mixture of methanol and water with a 1:1 ratio and in SDS 
in water at 10 mmol l−1, with respective baselines recorded before 
measurement. A Fourier transform filter was applied to minimize 
background effects. Secondary-structure fraction values were calcu -
lated using the single-spectrum analysis tool on the server BeStSel65. 
Ternary plots were created in https://www.ternaryplot.com/ and 
subsequently edited.
Outer-membrane permeabilization assays
NPN uptake assay was used to evaluate the ability of the peptides to per -
meabilize the bacterial outer membrane. Inocula of A. baumannii ATCC 
19606 were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 ml−1, centri-
fuged (9,391 g  at 4 °C for 10 min), washed and resuspended in 5 mmol l−1 
HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmol l−1 glucose. The bacterial 
solution was added to a white 96-well plate (100 μl per well) together 
with 4 μl of NPN at 0.5 mmol l−1. Subsequently, peptides diluted in water 
were added to each well, and the fluorescence was measured at excita -
tion wavelength (λex) = 350 nm and emission wavelength (λem) = 420 nm 
over time for 45 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the 
untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescent dye) as baseline and 
the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage difference 
between the baselines and the sample:

Cytoplasmic-membrane depolarization assays
The cytoplasmic-membrane depolarization assay was performed using 
the membrane-potential-sensitive dye DiSC3-5. A. baumannii  ATCC 
19606 in the mid-logarithmic phase were washed and resuspended 
at 0.05 optical density ml−1 (optical value at 600 nm) in HEPES buffer 
(pH 7.2) containing 20 mmol l−1 glucose and 0.1 mol l−1 KCl. DiSC3-5 at 
20 μmol l−1 was added to the bacterial suspension (100 μl per well) for 
15 min to stabilize the fluorescence, which indicates the incorporation 
of the dye into the bacterial membrane, and then the peptides were 
mixed 1:1 with the bacteria to a final concentration corresponding 
to their MIC values. Membrane depolarization was then followed by 
reading changes in the fluorescence (λex = 622 nm, λem = 670 nm) over 
time for 60 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the 
untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescent dye) as baseline and 
the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage difference 
between the baselines and the sample:

Eukaryotic cell culture conditions
HEK293T cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL-3216). The cells were 
cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin and 
streptomycin (antibiotics) and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Cytotoxicity assays
One day before the experiment, an aliquot of 100 μl of the cells 
at 50,000 cells ml−1 was seeded into each well of the cell-treated 
96-well plates used in the experiment (that is, 5,000 cells per well)45. 
The attached HEK293T cells were then exposed to increasing 
concentrations of the peptides (4–64 μmol l−1) for 24 h. After the 
incubation period, we performed the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT 
assay)45. The MTT reagent was dissolved at 0.5 mg ml−1 in medium 
without phenol red and was used to replace cell culture superna -
tants containing the peptides (100 μl per well), and the samples 
were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere contain-
ing 5% CO2, yielding the insoluble formazan salt. The resulting salts 
were then resuspended in hydrochloric acid (0.04 mol l−1) in anhy -
drous isopropanol and quantified by spectrophotometric measure-
ments of absorbance at 570 nm. All assays were carried out as three 
biological replicates.
Skin abscess infection mouse model
The backs of six-week-old female CD-1 mice under anaesthesia were 
shaved and injured with a superficial linear skin abrasion made with a 
needle. An aliquot of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (2 × 106 CFU ml−1; 20 μl) 
previously grown in LB medium until 0.5 optical density ml−1 (optical 
value at 600 nm) and then washed twice with sterile PBS (pH 7.4, 9,391 g 
for 3 min) was added to the scratched area. Peptides diluted in sterile 
water at MIC value were administered to the wound area 1 h after the 
infection. Two and four days after infection animals were euthanized, 
and the scarified skin was excised, homogenized using a bead beater 
(25 Hz for 20 min), tenfold serially diluted, and plated on McConkey 
agar plates for CFU quantification. The experiments were performed 
using six mice per group. Mice were housed in groups of three and 
maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity con -
trolled at 50%. The skin abscess infection mouse model was revised 
and approved by University Laboratory Animal Resources from the 
University of Pennsylvania (protocol 806763).
Deep thigh infection mouse model
Six-week-old female CD-1 mice were rendered neutropenic by two doses 
of cyclophosphamide (150 mg kg−1 and 100 mg kg−1) applied intraperi -
toneally 3 and 1 d before the infection. On day 4 of the experiment, the 
mice were infected in their right thighs with a 100-μl intramuscular 
injection of the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 in PBS at concentration of 
5 × 106 CFU ml−1. The bacterial cells were grown in LB broth, washed 
twice with PBS solution and diluted at the desired concentration. The 
peptides were administrated intraperitoneally 2 h after the infection. 
Two days after infection mice were euthanized, and the tissue from the 
right thigh was excised, homogenized using a bead beater (25 Hz for 
20 min), tenfold serially diluted, and plated on McConkey agar plates 
for bacterial colony counting. The experiments were performed using 
six mice per group. Mice were housed in groups of three and maintained 
under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity controlled at 50%. 
The deep thigh infection mouse model was revised and approved by 
University Laboratory Animal Resources from the University of Penn-
sylvania (protocol 807055).
